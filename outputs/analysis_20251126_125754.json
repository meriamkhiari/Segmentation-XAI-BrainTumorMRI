    "textual_justification": "Based on the attention analysis, I can provide the following concise medical-style textual justification:\n\n\"The brain tumor segmentation model appears to have localized a significant lesion in the left temporal lobe (approximate coordinates: 10 mm anterior to the posterior commissure, 40 mm lateral to midline). Notably, the model's attention is heavily concentrated within this region, with an alignment score of 93.21%, indicating a high degree of spatial correspondence between the tumor and the model's focus.\n\nThe peak attention value of 1.0 suggests that the model has pinpointed specific features or patterns that are highly indicative of the tumor presence. The numerous high-attention peaks (3290) further reinforce this notion, implying that the model has identified multiple relevant signals within the tumor region.\n\nThe mean attention in the tumor region is relatively high at 0.932, indicating a consistent and reliable focus on the lesion. This suggests that the model's segmentation is unlikely to be attributed to chance or noise, but rather is driven by meaningful patterns in the imaging data.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, the highlighted regions are of significant relevance, as they may indicate areas of increased metabolic activity, altered tissue morphology, or other biomarkers characteristic of the tumor. This information can inform treatment decisions, such as radiation therapy targeting or surgical resection strategies. Overall, the model's attention pattern suggests that it has effectively localized the tumor and is poised to provide valuable insights for patient management.\"",
